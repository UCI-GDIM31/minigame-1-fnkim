## Devlog
In the Unity engine, Components, GameObjects, and the Scene function like ingredients and pastries in a bakery. Components are like the ingredients in a
pastry. Ingredients give a baked good certain properties, like sugar making a cake sweet. Similarly, Components give GameObjects certain properties, like
a trigger collider making the MetalSpike parent object do something (kill the player) when the player touches it. The GameObjects are like pastries, so they are the completed product/asset that live in the Scene, which is the overall setting, like the bakery.
